# NGO-website
A modern, clean, and responsive frontend web page built using HTML and CSS. This project was created for MBDC'25 to demonstrate frontend design skills, with emphasis on layout, responsiveness, and aesthetics. It features a hero section, info blocks, and an interactive share button with tooltipâ€”all built from scratch without any CSS frameworks.
